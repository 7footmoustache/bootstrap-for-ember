# bootstrap-for-ember

_Bootstrap for Ember.js_ is a collection of UI components based on Twitter Bootstrap *v3* for Ember.js

Components are very clean and lightweight and most importantly very easy to use,


## Why?

Because Bootstrap is awesome but using it as is for _Ember_ apps makes code dirty as the interaction with Controllers
or other Ember components requires code wiring.


This project is heavily based on [Ember Components](http://emberjs.com/guides/components/), which makes the usage of
the components fun and doesnt ruin the simplicy of Bootstrap usage at all,
